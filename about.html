       <p>My name is Nessa, and this is my offical brow website! I have had the priviledge of servicing clients for a little over a year through BrowedByNessa, but I have been threading my own brows for over 7 years. </p>
    
    <p>I love connecting with clients and I truly appreciate every person who has supported me & my work! </p>
    
        <p>Outside of brows, I love listening to music, spending time with family & friends, & going to the gym. </p>
